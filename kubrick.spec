Kubrick is a game based on the Rubik's Cubeâ„¢ puzzle.

The cube sizes range from 2x2x2 up to 6x6x6, or you can play with irregular
"bricks" such as 5x3x2 or "mats" such as 6x4x1 or 2x2x1. The game has a
selection of puzzles at several levels of difficulty, as well as demos of
pretty patterns and solution moves, or you can make up your own puzzles.
